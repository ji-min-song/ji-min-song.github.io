title: About Me
---

Iâ€™m a M.S. student at  [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/miljbnu) in Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), under the supervision of Prof. Sang Jun Lee. I obtained my B.S degree in the Division of Electronic Engineering in JBNU. My research interest includes unsupervised learning, depth estimation, object pose estimation, and perception algorithms for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous driving.  

## Education

* M.S., Department of Electronic Engineering  
  Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Mar. 2022 ~ present.  
* B.S., Department of Electronic Engineering  
  Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Mar. 2016 ~ Feb. 2022.  

## Experience

### Mobile robot in smart home [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ArPYal89J9k)
#### Project Purpose and Role
* We intend to develop autonomous driving mobile robot that guarantee safety by CCTV and enhance convenience using Speech-To-Text (STT),Text-To-Speech (TSS) 
* I took a role that develop 1D-Lidar based autonomous driving in Robot Operating System (ROS) and enhance motor feedback control by rightly modeling our robot

## Ongoing Research
  
### 6-DoF Object pose estimation
#### Project Purpose and Role
<p align="center"><img src="https://ji-min-song.github.io/images/object pose estimation/object pose estimation structure.gif" width="100%" height="100%"></p>  

* The presence or absence of depth sensor is critical for variance of neural network's performance   
* So we research argorithm that estimate object pose based depth inferred by another network

### Around view depth estimation
#### Project Purpose and Role  
* Monocular depth estimation is the beginning of Around view depth estimation  
* So we research Unsupervised method performing similarly supervised method using Knowledge distillation
