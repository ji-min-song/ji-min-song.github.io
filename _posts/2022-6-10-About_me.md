title: About Me
---

I’m a M.S. student at  [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/miljbnu) in Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), under the supervision of Prof. Sang Jun Lee. I obtained my B.S. degree in the Division of Electronic Engineering in JBNU. My research interest includes unsupervised learning, depth estimation, object pose estimation, and perception algorithms for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous driving.  

## Education

* M.S., Department of Electronic Engineering  
  Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Mar. 2022 ~ present.  
* B.S., Department of Electronic Engineering  
  Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Mar. 2016 ~ Feb. 2022.  

## Experience

#### Project Purpose and Role  

<p align="center"><img src="https://ji-min-song.github.io/images/mobile robot/project1.PNG" width="100%" height="100%"></p>  

We developed a security robot platform that provides functions including:
* A mobile robot that autonomously navigates indoor environments  
* Mobile application and CCTV real-time streaming for monitoring in-house situation  
* User-friendly interface based on STT(speech-to-text) and TTS(text-to-speech)  
* Interaction with Internet of Things (IoT) modules in house  

I took a role that develop 1D-Lidar based autonomous driving in Robot Operating System (ROS) and enhance motor feedback control by rightly modeling our robot

#### Project Purpose and Role  

<p align="center"><img src="https://ji-min-song.github.io/images/face tracking/project.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"></p>  

We developed a auto face tracking system for one-person media creater that provides functions including:
* Real-time streaming by Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)  
* Recording video in off-line device  
* Face detection about only pre-registration  
* Active mechanical tracking system by pan and tilt motor  

I took a role that develop face detection using dlib and efficient tracking argorithm

#### Project Purpose and Role  

<p align="center"><img src="https://ji-min-song.github.io/images/webOS/project.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>  

We developed a solutions for "Car-to-smart home" situation that provides functions including:
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on webOS  
* Unlock car dashboard display by face detection about only pre-registration  
* Interaction with IoT modules like lighting, bath, entrance system and refrigerator in house  
* Inventory management in refrigerator by object detection  
* Unidirectional communication from entrance system to car dashboard by CCTV and MIC
* Driver state monitoring for prevention drowsy driving  

I took a role that develop driver face detection using Landmark detection and design digitization about drowsiness of driver

## Ongoing Research
  
### 6-DoF Object pose estimation
#### Project Purpose and Role  

<p align="center"><img src="https://ji-min-song.github.io/images/object pose estimation/object pose estimation structure.gif" width="100%" height="100%"></p>  

* The presence or absence of depth sensor is critical for variance of neural network's performance   
* So we research argorithm that estimate object pose based depth inferred by another network

### Around view depth estimation
#### Project Purpose and Role  

<p align="center"><img src="https://ji-min-song.github.io/images/depth estimation/around view.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>  

* Monocular depth estimation is the beginning of Around view depth estimation  
* So we research Unsupervised method performing similarly Supervised method using Knowledge distillation
